  How to do theming: https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-make-a-custom-theme-in-angular-material-d47122a1e361/

  For example, to do foreground or background colors in the COMPONENT .scss file do this:
  ```
  $primary: map-get($my-theme, primary);
  button { background-color: mat-color($primary); }
  ```

  This will modify the button background in regards to the theme, and work
  out of the box for the material "normal" classes.
  For example, the buttons have a color property that can be used like this.
